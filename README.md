# tally2obsi-py
A script to make migrating Notally notes to Obsidian possible!

## Version 0.2
- Now converts lists!
- Reworked same-day note ordination!
- Code is now (actually) readable!

## Usage
Just throw the source file and your 'NotallyDatabase' file into a folder (preferrably a new, temporary one), then run the script with Python. As shrimple as that!

## Questions
### Why bother making this?
Because I've long wanted to integrate my Notally notes into my Obsidian vault. What prevented me from doing so was the loss of creation timestamps that are preserved in the databaseâ€”an issue I've been trying to mitigate with my other notes.

### Why do you switch between single and double quotes?
I primarily use single quotes for characters and double for strings, but will alternate between the two if need be. (e.g. when double quotes are used within the string)

### Mac / Linux?
This script was made with Windows in mind, sorry. POSIX systems seem to be allergic to altering creation timestamps. Though, all you really have to do is modify the `system` method, the formatted timestamp, and pass your respective system's equivalent commands to it. Here's some notes that I've taken down on the matter:
- On POSIX, `touch` can't manipulate creation timestamps, so there's no unified solution for both MacOS and Linux.
- On MacOS, I've read that [`SetFile`](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250821280?answerId=251566149022) works, but it would need Xcode installed on the user end.
- On Linux, there's [`debugfs`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/36024), but I'm not confident in implementing such a thing.

### Do you have anything against Notally?
A little... for one, I don't like how it implemented text formatting on the backend. Despite that, I appreciate how well it works for notetaking on the go. It's a straight-forward, no-nonsense app, and I love it! You can go get it [here.](https://github.com/OmGodse/Notally)
