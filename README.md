# tally2obsi-py
A script to make Notally-to-Obsidian migration possible... on Windows.

## Usage
Just throw the source file and your 'NotallyDatabase' file into a folder (preferrably a new, temporary one), then run the script with Python. As shrimple as that!
Do ignore any spooky scary errors, I'm working on it!

## Questions
### Why bother making this?
Because I've long wanted to integrate my Notally notes into my Obsidian vault. What prevented me from doing so was the loss of creation timestamps that are preserved in the databaseâ€”an issue I've been trying to mitigate. And let's be real, you'd have to be insane to move about two years' worth of notes via copy-pasting.

### Mac / Linux?
This script was designed with Windows in mind, sorry. Though, all you really have to do is modify the `powershell` method and pass your respective system's equivalent commands.

### Do you have anything against Notally?
No, not at all! In fact, I appreciate the how well it works for me when notetaking on the go. It's a straight-forward, no-nonsense app, and I love it!
